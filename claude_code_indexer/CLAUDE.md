## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```

I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**

## üîí CRITICAL: User Confirmation Required

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL POLICY:**
- üö´ **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit user approval
- üö´ **NO NEW PATTERNS** without user understanding and consent  
- üö´ **NO REFACTORING** without user-requested direction
- üö´ **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** without detailed discussion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before implementing any new approach
- ‚úÖ **EXPLAIN REASONING** before proposing changes
- ‚úÖ **GET EXPLICIT CONSENT** for any pattern/practice introduction

### üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Workflow:
1. **ANALYZE** current code and requirements
2. **PROPOSE** specific changes with clear explanation
3. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding
4. **IMPLEMENT** only after explicit "yes" from user
5. **CONFIRM** results meet user expectations

**Example Interaction:**
```
Claude: "I notice we could apply the Strategy pattern here to reduce complexity. 
This would involve creating 3 new classes and moving logic from UserManager.
Would you like me to explain this approach and get your approval before proceeding?"

User: "Yes, explain it first"

Claude: [Explains pattern, shows before/after structure]
"Should I proceed with implementing the Strategy pattern as described?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

Claude: [Only then implements the changes]
```

### üöÄ START EVERY SESSION: Load Project Context First!
**IMPORTANT: At the beginning of EVERY new Claude Code session, run these commands to understand the project:**

```bash
# 1. Quick project overview (takes ~0.1s with cache)
claude-code-indexer stats

# 2. Show the most important code components
claude-code-indexer query --important --limit 20

# 3. View project structure and relationships
claude-code-indexer query --type class --limit 10
claude-code-indexer query --type function --limit 15
```

### ‚ö° Why Use Claude Code Indexer First?
- **64.6x faster** than re-reading files (0.07s vs 4.66s)
- **Instant context** - Cached analysis loads in milliseconds
- **Smart ranking** - See most important code first via PageRank
- **Relationship mapping** - Understand how code connects
- **Change detection** - Know what files were recently modified
- **Pattern recognition** - Detect design patterns and architectures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Claude Code Indexer is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**DO NOT re-implement code indexing functionality!** The `claude-code-indexer` package provides everything needed.

### Quick Start (Just Use These Commands!)
```bash
# 1. Install the package (if not already installed)
pip install claude-code-indexer

# 2. Initialize in current directory (auto-updates this file)
claude-code-indexer init

# 3. Index the codebase with performance optimizations
claude-code-indexer index . --workers 4

# 4. Use the indexed data
claude-code-indexer query --important           # Show key components
claude-code-indexer search auth user login      # Multi-keyword search
claude-code-indexer search db conn --mode all   # AND search (match all keywords)
claude-code-indexer stats                       # View statistics
claude-code-indexer index . --show-ignored      # See what files are ignored
```

### üéØ Recommended Workflow for Claude Code
1. **Start session** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer stats` to see project overview
2. **Before coding** ‚Üí Run `claude-code-indexer query --important` to understand key components
3. **When searching** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer search <terms>` with multiple keywords
4. **After changes** ‚Üí Re-run `claude-code-indexer index .` (uses cache, very fast)
5. **For debugging** ‚Üí Use `claude-code-indexer query --related <component>` to trace dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Principles & Patterns

### MANDATORY: Apply These Principles in Order

#### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - ALWAYS FIRST
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Over-engineered
class AbstractFactoryManager:
    # 100 lines for reading a file...

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Simple and direct  
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

#### 2. **ReAct Pattern** - Think Before Code
```python
"""
REASONING: Need user authentication
- Option 1: Build custom - Complex, time-consuming
- Option 2: Use library - Fast, tested
DECISION: Use established library (bcrypt)

ACTION: Implement using bcrypt
"""
def hash_password(password):
    return bcrypt.hash(password)
```

#### 3. **SOLID Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend, don't modify
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must substitute
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

#### 4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract

#### 5. **OOP Best Practices**
- Encapsulation: Hide internal state
- Composition > Inheritance
- Program to interfaces

#### 6. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for concepts
- Repositories for data access

#### 7. **EARS Requirements**
```
[WHEN <trigger>] [WHERE <state>] 
the <system> SHALL <action> [WITHIN <performance>]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & GOVERNANCE RULES

### üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Required

**All code changes, patterns, and architectural decisions MUST have explicit user approval.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS - STOP Immediately:
- User asks to "apply best practices" without specifics
- Request to "refactor" or "improve" without clear direction
- Suggestion to implement patterns not currently in use
- Any wholesale code reorganization request
- Adding new frameworks/libraries without discussion

### ‚úã PAUSE & ASK Protocol:
When you identify any of these situations:
1. **STOP** current activity
2. **EXPLAIN** what you observe
3. **PROPOSE** specific approach with pros/cons
4. **ASK** explicit permission: "Should I proceed with [specific action]?"
5. **WAIT** for clear user response
6. **IMPLEMENT** only after "yes"

### üìã User Approval Templates:

#### For New Patterns:
```
"I notice this code could benefit from the [PATTERN NAME] pattern. 
This would involve:
- Creating [X] new files: [file1.py, file2.py]  
- Moving [SPECIFIC CODE] from [current location]
- Changes in [X] existing files

This would improve [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] but add complexity.

Would you like me to:
A) Implement this pattern as described?
B) Show you the code changes first?
C) Skip this and keep current approach?
D) Discuss alternative approaches?"
```

#### For Refactoring:
```
"I see [SPECIFIC ISSUE] in [FILE/FUNCTION]. 
Current approach: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
Proposed solution: [DESCRIBE NEW APPROACH]
Files to change: [LIST FILES]

Should I proceed with this refactoring?"
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
"The current architecture is [DESCRIBE CURRENT].
I suggest restructuring to [DESCRIBE NEW].

This would require:
- Moving [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS]
- Creating new [INTERFACES/MODULES]  
- Updating [DEPENDENCIES]

Impact: [DESCRIBE BENEFITS AND RISKS]

This is a significant change. Do you want me to:
A) Proceed with full restructure?
B) Show detailed plan first?
C) Do partial changes only?
D) Keep current structure?"
```

### üéØ Safe Actions (No Approval Needed):
- **Bug fixes** with obvious solutions
- **Adding comments** for code clarity
- **Code formatting** (indentation, spacing)
- **Adding unit tests** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates**
- **Simple variable renaming** for clarity
- **Adding error handling** to existing patterns
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change interfaces

### üîí Approval Required Actions:
- **New classes/interfaces**
- **Design pattern implementation** 
- **File/folder restructuring**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Dependency additions**
- **Architecture pattern changes**
- **Code organization changes**
- **New development practices**

### üí¨ Communication Style:
- **BE EXPLICIT** about what you plan to do
- **ASK PERMISSION** before major changes
- **EXPLAIN REASONING** behind suggestions
- **OFFER OPTIONS** rather than deciding alone
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** of user requirements
- **RESPECT USER DECISIONS** even if you disagree

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Assume user wants "best practices" applied
- Implement patterns without explicit request
- Refactor working code without permission
- Change architecture without detailed discussion
- Add complexity without clear user benefit
- Make decisions about code organization alone

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask before implementing any new patterns
- Explain the current state before proposing changes  
- Get explicit consent for any refactoring
- Respect the existing codebase structure
- Focus on user-specified requirements
- Offer alternatives and let user choose

**Remember: The user is in control of their codebase. Your role is to help implement their vision, not impose your own architectural preferences.**
