# Claude Coding Assistant - Setup Rules

## Core Workflow Rules

1. **SEARCH FIRST**: Always search before adding/deleting anything. Use grep, find, or code indexer.
2. **First think through the problem**, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan.
3. **Make every task and code change as simple as possible**.
4. **Prioritize simplicity over complexity**.
