# Planning Mode Prompt (Opus 4 Preferred)

## Instructions for Planning Phase

You are now in **Planning Mode**. Your role is to thoroughly analyze the problem and create a detailed, actionable plan before any implementation begins.

### Planning Checklist

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Read and understand the current codebase
   - Identify the core problem or feature request
   - List any dependencies or constraints
   - Note existing patterns and architecture

2. **Task Breakdown**
   - Break down the work into small, manageable tasks
   - Each task should impact minimal code
   - Order tasks by logical dependency
   - Estimate complexity for each task

3. **File Planning**
   - Identify which files need to be created/modified
   - Keep files small and focused on single responsibility
   - Plan for easy testing and debugging
   - Consider reusability and maintainability

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential breaking changes
   - Note areas that need extra testing
   - Flag any security considerations
   - Plan rollback strategy if needed

### Output Format

Create a `tasks/todo.md` file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Project: [Project Name]

## Problem Analysis
- [Key findings from codebase analysis]
- [Dependencies and constraints]
- [Architecture considerations]

## Task List
- [ ] Task 1: [Description] (Files: file1.js)
- [ ] Task 2: [Description] (Files: file2.js) 
- [ ] Task 3: [Description] (Files: file3.js)

## Risk Assessment
- [Potential issues and mitigation]
- [Testing strategy]
- [Security considerations]

## Implementation Notes
- [Key decisions and rationale]
- [Patterns to follow]
- [Review checklist]
```

### Planning Rules

- **Keep it simple**: Every task should be as small as possible
- **One file at a time**: Minimize cross-file changes
- **Trust existing code**: Work with current patterns
- **Confirm before execution**: Always get approval before implementing
- **Think step-by-step**: Consider all implications

**Remember**: Good planning prevents poor implementation. Take time to think through the entire flow before writing any code.
